EthioMart has a vision to become the primary hub for all Telegram-based e-commerce activities in Ethiopia. With the increasing popularity of Telegram for business transactions, various independent e-commerce channels have emerged, each facilitating its own operations. However, this decentralization presents challenges for both vendors and customers who need to manage multiple channels for product discovery, order placement, and communication.

To solve this problem, EthioMart plans to create a single centralized platform that consolidates real-time data from multiple e-commerce Telegram channels into one unified channel. By doing this, they aim to provide a seamless experience for customers to explore and interact with multiple vendors in one place.

This project focuses on fine-tuning  LLMâ€™s for Amharic Named Entity Recognition (NER) system that extracts key business entities such as product names, prices, and Locations, from text, images, and documents shared across these Telegram channels. The extracted data will be used to populate EthioMart's centralised database, making it a comprehensive e-commerce hub.
